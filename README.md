# Time-Series-Analysis

## This project conntains several multivariate time sequence forcast:

### Traditional methods:
1. VAR - Vector Autoregression

### Machine Learning methods:
1. LSTM - Long Short-term Memory
2. Facebook Prophet


The performance of each algorithm is listed in folder 'Performance_Evaluation'. You may check the 'Comparison' in that folder and see the performance of each methods. For the implementation of each, you may check the 'VAR_Multivariate', 'LSTM_Multivariate' and 'Prophet_Multivariate' in the main folder.
